# Asp.net-MVC-Useful-Interfaces
Useful interfaces for ASP.NET MVC development.

This repository contains a few interfaces that I have developed for ASP.NET MVC in order to meet various needs. You can view a specific implementation by opening the folders in this repo. These interfaces were developed for MVC5 but should work for newer versions of MVC with little or no changes.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

Individual requirements will be listed in the interface's readme, contained in its folder in this repo.

## Usage
These files are provided as coding snippets. It is up to you to modify and implement them as needed. Generally, you can copy the folders into your project and begin using them.
